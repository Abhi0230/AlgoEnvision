# AlgoEnvision
AlgoEnvision tools are available online, but most of them are not effective in helping students to learn algorithm and data structures. And the reasons for this
can be the poor design, consideration of the tools to satisfy the learners’ needs in the usability, and accessibility.AlgoEnvision illustrates how algorithms work in a graphical way. AlgoEnvision is an software platform which provide a solution for teachers and students to teach and
learn online effective manner. It mainly focuses on ”AlgoEnvision”, which allows a better understanding of its flow and operations. It supports the integration of various lab into a
single application that dedicated to pre-assessment, algorithm explanation, visualization, coding, and post-assessment, etc. Teachers(user) can assign assignments to the students that can be
view manually or automatically. It also provides information on students performance, which can be calculated based on the result of various assessments, assignment submission, and module completions. AlgoEnvision can support typical learning systems in the areas of computer
engineering, especially in the area of data structures and algorithms.
